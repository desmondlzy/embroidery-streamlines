# Streamlines for Embroidery

Let the streamlines flow from your favorite photos to embroidery patterns you can sew on your hoodies using an automatic embroidery machine!

## Notice!

The code is a **research prototype**. It's not well-documented or optimized, and is nowhere near an end-user product.

The user interface for segmentation/color extraction which prepare the data for our algorithm on an user-provided image is not included.
However, you can use the data in the repo to reproduce our examples as described in the following sections.

Though, I'll be happy to help you with the problems you have: start an [issue](https://github.com/desmondlzy/embroidery-streamlines/issues) if you have questions, drop [me](mailto:desmondzyliu@gmail.com) an email if no response for too long.

## Environment Setup

The code is tested on Windows and macOS (M1).
Installation in a virtual environment via `conda` is recommended. The package list is provided at `environment.yml` or `environment-arm64.yml` for macOS or other arm64 system.

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

If you are on macOS, 

```
conda env create -f environment-arm64.yml
```

Reason: on macOS, `pip install triangle` or `pip install triangle==20220202` won't install you the correct version because the wheel for macOS appears not indexed by PyPi. 
A workaround is to pip [install the specific version from github repo](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13685920/install-specific-git-commit-with-pip). 
I'm only able to compile with python version up to 3.10.

<!-- ```bash
# On Apple Silicon machines, do this 
pip uninstall triangle
pip install git+https://github.com/drufat/triangle.git@v20220202
``` -->

## Run the scripts

A few interactive python scripts reside in the `examples` folder. You can run them from command line or interactively in [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py) or other IDEs, or export them to jupyter notebooks.

### `examples/run_multiple_patches.py` 
Run the pipeline on the density and direction fields extracted from each segment of an image. Generate a preview of the embroidery pattern, and `.emb` files that can be used on the Bernina B590 machine.

### `examples/run_interactive_regularization.py`
Demo of the interactive regularization. An example of a horizontal direction field and a linearly increasing density field is used here. A pyplot popup will appear for the interactive demo.

### `examples/run_analytical_field.py`
Run the pipeline on some analytical fields, please check the source code to choose from the fields available, or define your own fields.
